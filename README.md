# React Native Notes

- `react` is a library that helps you create user interfaces.

- `react` is a platform-independent library.

- `react-dom` is the library on top of `react`, which helps you make web interfaces.

- `react-native` is the library on top of `react`, which helps you make mobile device interfaces.


## React Native

- `react-native` library provides you [UI components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis) library. Which are later compiled into native platforms.

- It also exposes platform-specific API to use the hardware of the device e.g., camera etc. 

- You should have knowledge `react` before you work on `react-native` but not required. You can learn the [core concepts](https://reactnative.dev/docs/intro-react) of `react` while learning `react-native` too.

- UI components/views are compiled to native views but JS logic is not compiled. It run in JS thread hosted by `react-native`

- `reacti-native` spins a JS process as part of your app and facilitates the communication between your JS code and compiled native components (also called a bridge).

## [Setting Up The Development Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

You have 2 methods to setup your development environment.

1. Expo Go CLI (Third Party)
2. React Native CLI (Provided by `react` team)

Working with Expo Go CLI is easy as compare to work with React Native.
